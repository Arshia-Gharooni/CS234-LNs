## 2. Difficulties

  A few difficulties! Besides school, these lectures were very dense! Information was packed into the last few minutes of class too. I thought this was great (more material the better). I'm still a newbie in RL, but I think this lecture series, more than anything, provided me the landscape of modern RL and gave me insights into a a number of nooks and crannies. This lecture series definitely helped solidify my fundamental understanding of RL. I remember before I'd always mix up the different Bellman equation flavors. Why does one equation have states and actions while the other has only states? These small things would always stump me! These lectures certainly clarified all of that for me. I also think a lot of RL is theoretical! The math is definitely heavy. This made some parts of the lecture a bit more dense than usual. I ended up spending a lot of time going through these lectures, but it was all worth it!
